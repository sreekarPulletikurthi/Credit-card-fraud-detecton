# Credit-card-fraud-detecton


The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. 
I used a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally,
Gradient Boosting Classifier that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones.
